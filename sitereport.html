				Welcome to my sitereport.<br>
=======
			<h1 class="site-heading">Overview</h1>
			<p class="site-content ">
				Welcome to my sitereport.<br><br>
>>>>>>> sitereport
				This report details my journey in learning web development, coding, design, debugging process and my experience throughout the whole development cycle of this website.<br>
			</p>
			<h1 class="site-heading">Learning HTML and CSS</h1>
			<p class="site-content">
				My journey began with learning the fundamentals of HTML and CSS.<br><br>
				HTML, the backbone of web pages, allowed me to structure my content effectively. I learned about different tags, attributes, and the importance of structure in HTML.<br><br>
    			CSS brought life to the structure by enabling me to style and layout the elements. I explored various properties, selectors, and learned about the box model, positioning, and responsive design techniques. This foundational knowledge was crucial in building a visually appealing and user-friendly website.
			</p>
			<h1 class="site-heading">Learning Git and Github</h1>
			<p class="site-content">
				Version control became an integral part of my development process, and learning Git and GitHub was a significant milestone.<br><br>
				Git allowed me to track changes, and manage different versions of my code. I began by learning fundamental commands such as git clone, git add, git commit, and git push.<br><br>
				GitHub provided a platform to host my repositories and showcase my projects. I learned how to create repositories, make commits, push changes, create branches, and merge them. This knowledge not only improved my workflow but also prepared me for collaborative projects in the future.
			</p>
			<h1 class="site-heading">Design Layout</h1>
			<p class="site-content">
				Another paragraph with<br>
				some spaced lines.
			</p>
			<h1 class="site-heading">Navigation Bar</h1>
			<p class="site-content">
				The navigation bar is a crucial component of the website, providing easy access to the different pages. I designed a responsive navigation bar that adapts to various screen sizes.<br><br>
    			Using a little bit of Javascript, I created a hamburger menu which only appears on mobile devices. This approach improved the overall usability and accessibility of the website.<br><br>
				Although this assignment is focused on HTML and CSS, I used javascript to create the hamburger menu. This is highlighted in the <a class ="site-link" href="#challenges-solutions">'Challenges and Solutions'</a> section of this sitereport.
			</p>
			<h1 class="site-heading">Homepage</h1>
			<p class="site-content">
				The homepage serves as the landing page of my portfolio website. It includes an image of me, an introduction, links to my github and linkedin pages, and some information about me.<br><br>
				I used a combination of images, text, and social links to create a welcoming and visually appealing homepage. The layout is clean and organized, making it easy for visitors to navigate and explore the website.
			</p>
			<h1 class="site-heading">Projects</h1>
			<p class="site-content">
				The 'display:grid' property has been used inorder to display the 6 projects.<br><br>
    			Since, this is our first assignment, the projects are not linked to any other page and placeholder images have been used. However, in the future, I plan to link them to their respective project pages.<br><br>
			</p>
			<h1 class="site-heading">Contact</h1>
			<p class="site-content">
				The contact page provides visitors with the means to get in touch with me. It includes a contact form, social media links, and other relevant contact information.<br><br>
    			I ensured that the form is user-friendly and accessible, using appropriate labels and placeholders. The social media links are easily accessible, allowing visitors to connect with me on different platforms.<br><br>
			</p>
			<h1 class="site-heading">Video Demonstration URL</h1>
			<p class="site-content">
				The video demonstration provides a visual walkthrough of the website, showcasing its features and functionality. You can view the video demonstration here:<br>
    			<a class="site-link" href="YOUR_VIDEO_URL_HERE">Watch the Video Demonstration</a><br><br>
    			This video highlights the design, navigation, and key elements of the website, offering a comprehensive overview of the project.
			</p>
			<h1 class="site-heading">Responsive Design</h1>
			<p class="site-content">
				Ensuring that the website is responsive was a priority throughout the development process. I used media queries and flexible layouts to make the website adaptable to different screen sizes and devices.<br><br>
    			This involved rigorous testing using Chrome Developer Tools and making adjustments to improve the user experience. The goal was to provide a seamless and consistent experience across desktops and mobile phones.
			</p>
			<h1 id="challenges-solutions" class="site-heading">Challenges and Solutions</h1>
			<p class="site-content">
				Throughout the development process, I encountered several challenges, including layout issues, browser compatibility problems, and debugging errors. Each challenge presented an opportunity to learn and improve my skills.<br><br>
    			By researching solutions, seeking help from online communities, and experimenting with different approaches, I overcame these obstacles. Documenting these challenges and solutions helped me understand the importance of persistence and problem-solving in web development.
			</p>
			<h1 class="site-heading">Validation report</h1>
			<p class="site-content">
				Ensuring that the website's HTML and CSS validate was an essential step in the development process. I used the W3C validation tools to check for errors and ensure compliance with web standards.<br><br>
    			<img src="YOUR_VALIDATION_REPORT_IMAGE_URL_HERE" alt="Validation Report Screenshot">
    			This validation process helped me identify and fix issues, ensuring that the website is well-structured and accessible.
			</p>
			<h1 class="site-heading">Conclusion</h1>
			<p class="site-content">
				In conclusion, this project has been an enriching experience, allowing me to develop and showcase my web development skills. From learning HTML and CSS to implementing responsive design and debugging, each step has contributed to my growth as a developer.<br><br>
    			I look forward to applying these skills to future projects and continuing to learn and evolve in the field of web development.
